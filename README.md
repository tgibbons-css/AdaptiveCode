AdaptiveCode
============

Code samples to accompany the book Adaptive Code Via C#.

There are a number of examples in this book that don't compile, don't run, or have some other errors.
This fork tries to fix the majors issues.

First, the sprint in the adaptive sample at the end of the book. These do not compile or run in Visual Studio 2015 and have a number of issues. 
The project sample-sprint2-baseline has been fixed and now runs with basic functionality. This version of the project has all the features/stories from
the first sprint completed.
